Reservations
=================

Reservations can be made more than 3 hours in the future away unconditionally at any pickup point,
or can be made less than 3 hours in the future at any pickup point that currently has a surplus
of bikes.

Any reservation made for more than 3 hours from now will be checked when there is exactly 3 hours left
and a bike, if there is not one available, will be manually sourced and made available.
